**If not all applications are showing up:**

- Wait for the initial scan to complete (may take a moment on first run).
- Check the console for any error messages during scanning.

**If hotkeys don't work:**
- Make sure another application isn't already using the same hotkeys.
- Try running the launcher as administrator.
- Check the console for any error messages related to hotkey registration.
- Note that the keyboard library requires administrative privileges on some systems.
